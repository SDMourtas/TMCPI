# Time-Varying Minimum-Cost Portfolio Insurance
Minimum-cost portfolio insurance (MCPI) is a well-known investment strategy that tries to limit the losses a portfolio may incur as stocks decrease in price without requiring the portfolio manager to sell those stocks. This repository contains the time-varying MCPI (TMCPI) problem, which is defined as a time-varying linear programming (TVLP) problem. 
The purpose of this package is to solve online the continuous-time version of the TMCPI problem by using different error-correction neural networks (ENNs). These neural network (NN) solvers are the zeroing NN (ZNN), the linear-variational-inequality primalâ€“dual NN (LVI-PDNN), and the simplified LVI-PDNN (S-LVI-PDNN).

# Installation
*	Unzip the file you just downloaded and copy the TMCPI directory to a location,e.g.,/my-directory/
*	Run Matlab/Octave, Go to /my-directory/TMCPI/ at the command prompt
*	run 'Main_TMCPI' (Matlab/Octave)

# Results
After running the Main_TMCPI.m file, the package outputs are the following:
*	The optimal portfolio of the selected TMCPI problem created by ENNs.
*	The time consumptions of ENNs and linprog.
*	The graphic illustration of the portfolio weights along with the portfolios insurance costs, payoff and the error between the ENNs and linprog.

# Environment
The TMCPI package has been tested in Matlab 2021a on OS: Windows 10 64-bit.
